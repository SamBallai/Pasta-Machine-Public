Given your Discord & Reddit API keys, this code scrapes the top posts from r/copypasta and tunes/poisons a GPT2 model on them. 

The model and data have been omitted due to github size limits, but creating them yourself is trivial as all the code in here produces them. 

Alternatively, feel free to drop me a message and I can send them to you. Happy pasta-making!
